Moving PICBAGE TO LIBRE WEBSITE:
================================

Steps:
------

NOTE: Currently, I localized everything for testing purposes.

1. In base template (/picbadge/templates/page_template.html)
	- make sure CSS and JAVASCRIPT links are correct.
	- the base templates contains following tags\
		<head> 
			{% block extrahead %}{% endblock %}
		</head>
		
		and
		
		<body>
			<!--NOTE:  UNDER CONTENT WRAPPER -->
			{% block content %}{% endblock %}
		</body>
	
	
2. All the other templates have include line on the top .. and have the same name as of the base template ( which is "page_template.html" currently).

3. READ THE "READ ME" FOR THE PROJECT FOR PROJECT SPECFIC SETTINGS if you have moved it to new location.
